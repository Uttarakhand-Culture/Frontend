# Contributing to Uttarakhand Culture Preservation Project 🏔️✨

## Introduction and Purpose 🌟

This project aims to create a web platform dedicated to preserving Uttarakhandi culture.

The objective of this project is to address the concerning trend of the younger generation losing touch with their cultural roots and to safeguard the traditional rituals, gods, and unique practices of Uttarakhand. We believe it's crucial to bridge this gap and ensure the preservation of our cultural identity for generations to come.
